;; This file is a hack for ~/.emacs under Windows that tries to load a startup
;; file that is unique to each user.  That file is:
;;
;; C:\Documents and Settings\elvis\Application Data\GNU Emacs\.emacs
;;
;; where "elvis" is the user's login name.  The environment variable
;; USERPROFILE is used because "elvis" may actually be "elvis.GRACELAND"
;; if there are users named elvis both on the local machine and in the
;; domain graceland.  If the file can't be found, we silently do nothing.
